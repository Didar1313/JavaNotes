# 📝 Java Collections Framework - Questions & Answers  

### 🔹 1. What interface does the `Collection` interface extend?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface.**  

### 🔹 2. How many main categories of interfaces exist in the Collections Framework?  
💡 **There are two main categories of interfaces in the Collections Framework: `Collection` and `Map`.**  

### 🔹 3. Does the `Collection` interface belong to the Collections Framework?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface, but `Iterable` is not part of the Collections Framework.**  

### 🔹 4. What are the main, sub, and side categories in the Collections Framework?  
- 🔹 **Main categories:** `Collection` and `Map`  
- 🔹 **Subcategory:** `Queue`  
- 🔹 **Side category:** `Iterator`  

### 🔹 5. Which class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface?  
💡 **The `Vector` class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface.**  

### 🔹 6. What should be used instead of `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **If you are using a `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment, then you can safely replace it with `ArrayList`.**  

### 🔹 7. Which class extends `Vector`, and what should replace it in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **The `Stack` class extends `Vector` and should be replaced by `ArrayDeque` in non-concurrent environments.**  

### 🔹 8. Which interface does the `Vector` class use to model its iterator?  
💡 **The `Vector` class uses the `Enumeration` interface to model its iterator.** 

### **Question 9:**  
🔹 **What is the key difference between a `Set` and a `Collection`?**  

✅ **Answer:** A `Set` **does not allow duplicates**, while a `Collection` can contain duplicates.

### **Question 10:**  
🔹 **Can you have a container that prevents duplicates and allows indexed access in Java?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
No, **there is no direct implementation** in the Collections Framework that provides both **unique elements (`Set` behavior)** and **indexed access (`List` behavior)**.  
- Some `Set` implementations (`LinkedHashSet`) **preserve insertion order**, but they **do not provide index-based access** like a `List`.  
- If both uniqueness and indexing are required, you would have to **use a combination** of `Set` and `List` or a **custom data structure**.

### **Questionm 11:**  
🔹 **What are the different ways to convert a `Collection` into an array, and how do they differ?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
The `Collection` interface provides **three** ways to convert elements into an array using `toArray()`:  

1️⃣ **`toArray()` (no arguments)** → Returns an `Object[]`, which may require **unsafe casting**.  
2️⃣ **`toArray(T[] tab)`** → Returns an array of the same type as `T[]`, ensuring **type safety** but requiring a predefined array.  
3️⃣ **`toArray(IntFunction<T[]> generator)`** → Uses a **method reference or lambda** for **better readability** and avoids manual array creation.

### **Question 12:**  
🔹 **Why does calling `remove()` on an immutable collection throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
An **immutable collection** does not allow modifications after creation. Since `remove()` is an operation that alters the collection, calling it **violates immutability** and results in an **`UnsupportedOperationException`**.

### **Question 13:**  
🔹 **Why does modifying a collection while iterating over it cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
When you modify a collection **directly** (e.g., using `remove()`) while iterating over it, the iterator detects this change and throws a **`ConcurrentModificationException`** to prevent unpredictable behavior. Instead, use **`removeIf()`** for safe removal.

### **Question 14:** 
🔹 ** What is the main difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?  

✅ **Answer:**  
- `ArrayList` is **faster for iteration and random access** because it uses an internal array.  
- `LinkedList` is **better for frequent insertions and deletions** at the start or end since it is a doubly-linked list.  
- **Use `ArrayList` for general purposes** and **`LinkedList` for LIFO (Stack) or FIFO (Queue) operations**.  

---

### **Question 15:** 
🔹 ** What happens if you try to access an invalid index in a `List`?  

✅ **Answer:** Trying to `get(index)`, `set(index, value)`, `remove(index)`, or `add(index, value)` with an invalid index **throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`**. Always check the index range before using these methods.  

---

### **Question 16:** 
🔹 ** How does `subList(start, end)` work, and what should you be careful about?  

✅ **Answer:**  
- `subList(start, end)` **creates a view of the original list**, meaning any modifications affect both lists.  
- ⚠️ **Be cautious**: Modifying the original list after creating a sublist **may cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`**.  

---

### **Question 17:** 
🔹 **How does `sort()` work in Java’s `List` interface?  

✅ **Answer:**  
- Java SE 8 introduced `sort(Comparator<T>)` to sort lists directly.  
- If elements **don’t implement `Comparable`**, calling `sort()` without a comparator **throws a `ClassCastException`**.  
- You can use `Comparator.naturalOrder()` for natural sorting.
