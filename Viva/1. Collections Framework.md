# 📝 Java Collections Framework - Questions & Answers  

### 🔹 1. What interface does the `Collection` interface extend?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface.**  

### 🔹 2. How many main categories of interfaces exist in the Collections Framework?  
💡 **There are two main categories of interfaces in the Collections Framework: `Collection` and `Map`.**  

### 🔹 3. Does the `Collection` interface belong to the Collections Framework?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface, but `Iterable` is not part of the Collections Framework.**  

### 🔹 4. What are the main, sub, and side categories in the Collections Framework?  
- 🔹 **Main categories:** `Collection` and `Map`  
- 🔹 **Subcategory:** `Queue`  
- 🔹 **Side category:** `Iterator`  

### 🔹 5. Which class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface?  
💡 **The `Vector` class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface.**  

### 🔹 6. What should be used instead of `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **If you are using a `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment, then you can safely replace it with `ArrayList`.**  

### 🔹 7. Which class extends `Vector`, and what should replace it in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **The `Stack` class extends `Vector` and should be replaced by `ArrayDeque` in non-concurrent environments.**  

### 🔹 8. Which interface does the `Vector` class use to model its iterator?  
💡 **The `Vector` class uses the `Enumeration` interface to model its iterator.** 

### **Question 9:**  
🔹 **What is the key difference between a `Set` and a `Collection`?**  

✅ **Answer:** A `Set` **does not allow duplicates**, while a `Collection` can contain duplicates.

### **Question 10:**  
🔹 **Can you have a container that prevents duplicates and allows indexed access in Java?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
No, **there is no direct implementation** in the Collections Framework that provides both **unique elements (`Set` behavior)** and **indexed access (`List` behavior)**.  
- Some `Set` implementations (`LinkedHashSet`) **preserve insertion order**, but they **do not provide index-based access** like a `List`.  
- If both uniqueness and indexing are required, you would have to **use a combination** of `Set` and `List` or a **custom data structure**.

### **Questionm 11:**  
🔹 **What are the different ways to convert a `Collection` into an array, and how do they differ?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
The `Collection` interface provides **three** ways to convert elements into an array using `toArray()`:  

1️⃣ **`toArray()` (no arguments)** → Returns an `Object[]`, which may require **unsafe casting**.  
2️⃣ **`toArray(T[] tab)`** → Returns an array of the same type as `T[]`, ensuring **type safety** but requiring a predefined array.  
3️⃣ **`toArray(IntFunction<T[]> generator)`** → Uses a **method reference or lambda** for **better readability** and avoids manual array creation.

### **Question 12:**  
🔹 **Why does calling `remove()` on an immutable collection throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
An **immutable collection** does not allow modifications after creation. Since `remove()` is an operation that alters the collection, calling it **violates immutability** and results in an **`UnsupportedOperationException`**.

### **Question 13:**  
🔹 **Why does modifying a collection while iterating over it cause a `ConcurrentModificationException`?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
When you modify a collection **directly** (e.g., using `remove()`) while iterating over it, the iterator detects this change and throws a **`ConcurrentModificationException`** to prevent unpredictable behavior. Instead, use **`removeIf()`** for safe removal.



14. ✅ **Difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` & When to Use Each:**  
   - `ArrayList` is backed by an array, making it **faster for iteration and random access**.  
   - `LinkedList` is a doubly linked list, making it **faster for frequent insertions/deletions at the beginning or end**.  
   - **Use `ArrayList`** for general use cases and when random access is needed.  
   - **Use `LinkedList`** when frequently adding/removing elements at the start or end.  

15. ✅ **How `subList()` Works & Caution:**  
   - `subList(start, end)` returns a **view** of the original list, meaning changes in the sublist reflect in the main list.  
   - ⚠️ **Be cautious**: Modifying the original list after creating a sublist can lead to `ConcurrentModificationException`.  

16. ✅ **Purpose of `ListIterator` vs Regular `Iterator`:**  
   - `ListIterator` extends `Iterator` and allows **bi-directional traversal** using `hasPrevious()` and `previous()`.  
   - It also allows modifications like `set(element)`, unlike a regular `Iterator`.  

17. ✅ **How `sort()` Works in Java’s `List` Interface:**  
   - Java SE 8 introduced `sort(Comparator<T>)` for sorting lists.  
   - If elements **don’t implement `Comparable`**, calling `sort()` without a comparator will cause a `ClassCastException`.
