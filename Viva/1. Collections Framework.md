# 📝 Java Collections Framework - Questions & Answers  

### 🔹 1. What interface does the `Collection` interface extend?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface.**  

### 🔹 2. How many main categories of interfaces exist in the Collections Framework?  
💡 **There are two main categories of interfaces in the Collections Framework: `Collection` and `Map`.**  

### 🔹 3. Does the `Collection` interface belong to the Collections Framework?  
💡 **The `Collection` interface extends the `Iterable` interface, but `Iterable` is not part of the Collections Framework.**  

### 🔹 4. What are the main, sub, and side categories in the Collections Framework?  
- 🔹 **Main categories:** `Collection` and `Map`  
- 🔹 **Subcategory:** `Queue`  
- 🔹 **Side category:** `Iterator`  

### 🔹 5. Which class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface?  
💡 **The `Vector` class has been retrofitted to implement the `List` interface.**  

### 🔹 6. What should be used instead of `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **If you are using a `Vector` in a non-concurrent environment, then you can safely replace it with `ArrayList`.**  

### 🔹 7. Which class extends `Vector`, and what should replace it in a non-concurrent environment?  
💡 **The `Stack` class extends `Vector` and should be replaced by `ArrayDeque` in non-concurrent environments.**  

### 🔹 8. Which interface does the `Vector` class use to model its iterator?  
💡 **The `Vector` class uses the `Enumeration` interface to model its iterator.** 

### **Question 9:**  
🔹 **What is the key difference between a `Set` and a `Collection`?**  

✅ **Answer:** A `Set` **does not allow duplicates**, while a `Collection` can contain duplicates.

### **Question 10:**  
🔹 **Can you have a container that prevents duplicates and allows indexed access in Java?**  

✅ **Answer:**  
No, **there is no direct implementation** in the Collections Framework that provides both **unique elements (`Set` behavior)** and **indexed access (`List` behavior)**.  
- Some `Set` implementations (`LinkedHashSet`) **preserve insertion order**, but they **do not provide index-based access** like a `List`.  
- If both uniqueness and indexing are required, you would have to **use a combination** of `Set` and `List` or a **custom data structure**.
