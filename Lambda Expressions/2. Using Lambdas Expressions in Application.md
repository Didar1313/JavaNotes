### What is a Lambda Expression? 🤔

* Lambda expressions let you write **short blocks of code** (like mini-functions) in a super simple way.
* Before Java 8, you had to write a lot of code with **anonymous classes** to pass behavior (like functions) around.
* Now, with **lambdas**, you can pass behavior with clean, short code!

### What is a Functional Interface? 🧩

* A **Functional Interface** is an interface with **exactly one abstract method**.
* It’s like a contract for a single action.
* Lambda expressions fit perfectly here because they implement that single method.

### Java’s `java.util.function` Package 🗃️

Java 8 came with many **ready-made functional interfaces** in this package to cover common tasks. They fall into 4 big groups:

---

## 1️⃣ Supplier — "I provide you something" 🎁

* **No input**, but **returns something**.
* Example: You ask it for a `String`, it gives it to you.

```java
Supplier<String> supply = () -> "Hello!";
System.out.println(supply.get());  // prints "Hello!"
```

* Specialized versions exist for primitive types, like `IntSupplier` for int values, to avoid slow boxing/unboxing.

---

## 2️⃣ Consumer — "I take something, but don’t give back" 👐

* Takes an input but **returns nothing**.
* Used when you want to **do something with data**, like print it or save it.

```java
Consumer<String> print = s -> System.out.println(s);
print.accept("Hi!");  // prints "Hi!"
```

* Variants:

  * `IntConsumer` for ints.
  * `BiConsumer<T, U>` takes two inputs.

---

## 3️⃣ Predicate — "I test something and say true or false" ✅❌

* Takes input, returns a boolean.
* Useful for **filtering** or making decisions.

```java
Predicate<Integer> isEven = n -> n % 2 == 0;
System.out.println(isEven.test(4));  // true
```

* Variants:

  * `IntPredicate` for int input.
  * `BiPredicate<T, U>` takes two inputs.

---

## 4️⃣ Function — "I transform one thing into another" 🔄

* Takes input, returns output.
* Used to **convert** or **map** values.

```java
Function<String, Integer> toLength = s -> s.length();
System.out.println(toLength.apply("Hello"));  // prints 5
```

---

### Why Use Specialized Interfaces for Primitives? 🏃‍♂️💨

* Normal generics like `Function<Integer, Integer>` cause boxing (wrapping primitive `int` into an object), which slows things down.
* Specialized interfaces like `IntSupplier`, `IntPredicate`, or `IntFunction` avoid this by working directly with primitive types.

### Summary 📝

| Interface Group | Input     | Output           | Example Use                        |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Supplier**    | None      | Provides a value | Generate random number, get config |
| **Consumer**    | Takes one | Returns nothing  | Print to console, save to DB       |
| **Predicate**   | Takes one | Returns boolean  | Check if a number is even          |
| **Function**    | Takes one | Returns a value  | Convert String to Integer          |

### Quick Tips for Beginners 💡

* Look for interfaces with **one method** to use lambdas.
* Use **`Supplier`** when you need to **get** something.
* Use **`Consumer`** when you want to **do something with input** but no output.
* Use **`Predicate`** to **test or check conditions**.
* Use **`Function`** to **convert or map** from one type to another.
* Use **primitive specialized interfaces** to keep your code fast!
