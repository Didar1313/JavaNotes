### **Exploring the Set Interface**  

- A **Set** in Java is like a collection where you can store items, but it **does not allow duplicates**.  
- Unlike a **List**, a **Set does not maintain any specific order** of elements. This means when you retrieve items, they may appear in a different order than how you added them.  
- **HashSet** is the most common implementation of **Set**. Internally, it uses a **HashMap** to store elements efficiently.  
- Since **HashSet** does not guarantee order, you should not write code assuming elements will stay in the same sequence.  

**Example:**  
```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(List.of("one", "two", "three"));
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
set.addAll(strings);
set.forEach(System.out::println); // set.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s)); //System.out::println is a method reference to System.out.println(), meaning for each element in set, 
                                                                              //it will be passed as an argument to println().
```  
This may print elements in a random order like:  
``` 
one  
two  
three  
```
### **Why does the order look like this?**  
1. **Hashing Mechanism**:  
   - When you add an element to a **HashSet**, it calculates a **hash code** for that element.
   - This hash code decides where the element is placed in memory.
   - The hash codes are not necessarily in the same order as insertion.

**Note:** If you need a **Set that maintains order**, use **LinkedHashSet** instead of **HashSet**:  
```java
Set<String> set = new LinkedHashSet<>(List.of("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"));
```  
This will maintain the **insertion order** when iterating.

### **Extending Set with SortedSet**  

- **SortedSet** is an extension of **Set** that keeps elements in **sorted order**.  
- The most common implementation is **TreeSet**, which sorts elements **automatically** using either:  
  - A **Comparator** (provided when creating the set).  
  - The **Comparable** interface (implemented by the elements).  
- If both are provided, the **Comparator** takes precedence.  

### **Key Methods of SortedSet**  
1. `first()` → Returns the **smallest** element.  
2. `last()` → Returns the **largest** element.  
3. `headSet(toElement)` → Returns elements **less than** `toElement`.  
4. `tailSet(fromElement)` → Returns elements **greater than or equal to** `fromElement`.  
5. `subSet(fromElement, toElement)` → Returns elements **between** `fromElement` (inclusive) and `toElement` (exclusive).  

### **Example Code (Main Part)**  
```java
SortedSet<String> strings = new TreeSet<>(Set.of("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"));
SortedSet<String> subSet = strings.subSet("aa", "d"); 
System.out.println("Sub set = " + subSet);
```
### **Output:**  
```
Sub set = [b, c]
```
**Why this output?**  
- `"aa"` is **not** in the set, but it starts from the closest element (`"b"`). `"a"`<`"aa"`.  
- `"d"` is **excluded**, so the subset stops at `"c"`.
