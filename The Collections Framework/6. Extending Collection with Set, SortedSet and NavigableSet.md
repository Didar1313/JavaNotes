### **Exploring the Set Interface**  

- A **Set** in Java is like a collection where you can store items, but it **does not allow duplicates**.  
- Unlike a **List**, a **Set does not maintain any specific order** of elements. This means when you retrieve items, they may appear in a different order than how you added them.  
- **HashSet** is the most common implementation of **Set**. Internally, it uses a **HashMap** to store elements efficiently.  
- Since **HashSet** does not guarantee order, you should not write code assuming elements will stay in the same sequence.  

**Example:**  
```java
Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(List.of("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"));
set.forEach(System.out::println);
```  
This may print elements in a random order like:  
```
six  
four  
one  
two  
three  
five  
```  
But the order may change when you run it again.
