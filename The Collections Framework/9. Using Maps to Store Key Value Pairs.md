### **Using Maps to Store Key-Value Pairs**

In Java, a **Map** is a collection that stores data in **key-value pairs**. Each key is unique and maps to a corresponding value. This concept is fundamental for organizing data in a way that allows quick access to the value based on its key. Think of it as a **dictionary**, where each word (key) has a corresponding definition (value).

#### **How Does a Map Work?**
- **Key**: Represents a unique identifier (e.g., an invoice number).
- **Value**: The associated data (e.g., the invoice details).
  
### **Example:**
If you were managing invoices, you could have:
- **Keys**: Invoice numbers (e.g., 101, 102, 103).
- **Values**: Invoice objects containing detailed information about each invoice.

So, a Map allows you to **retrieve values quickly using their keys**.

### **Map Interface Hierarchy**
There are several types of Maps in Java:
1. **Map Interface**: The basic map interface.
2. **SortedMap**: A map that sorts the keys automatically.
3. **NavigableMap**: A map that provides navigation methods for traversing keys (e.g., finding the next or previous key).

#### **Key Implementations**:
1. **HashMap**: A commonly used implementation of the Map interface. It stores key-value pairs without any particular order.
2. **LinkedHashMap**: Similar to `HashMap`, but it maintains the insertion order of the key-value pairs.
3. **IdentityHashMap**: A specialized Map where equality of keys is checked based on their references (not their content).
   
#### **Multimap Concept**:
A **Multimap** allows multiple values to be associated with the same key. Java's `Map` does not support this directly, but you can simulate this behavior by using a `Map` where values are lists or collections.

### **Creating Maps Using Factory Methods**

Java SE 9 introduced methods to create **immutable maps** easily. Hereâ€™s how you can create small maps:

#### **Creating a Small Map**:
```java
Map<Integer, String> map = Map.of(
    1, "one",
    2, "two",
    3, "three"
);
```

#### **Creating a Map with More Than 10 Entries**:
For larger maps (more than 10 entries), use the `Map.entry()` method to create map entries:
```java
Map.Entry<Integer, String> e1 = Map.entry(1, "one");
Map.Entry<Integer, String> e2 = Map.entry(2, "two");
Map.Entry<Integer, String> e3 = Map.entry(3, "three");

Map<Integer, String> map = Map.ofEntries(e1, e2, e3);
```

### **Rules for Key-Value Pairs**:
1. **Unique Keys**: Each key in the map must be unique, but the values can repeat.
2. **Key-Value Operations**:
   - **Put**: Add a key-value pair.
   - **Get**: Retrieve a value by its key.
   - **Remove**: Remove a key-value pair.
   
### **Additional Operations**:
- Check if the map is **empty**.
- Get the **size** of the map (i.e., number of key-value pairs).
- **Clear** the map (remove all key-value pairs).
  
Maps provide a lot of flexibility to manage data efficiently, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate key-value pairs.

---

### **Summary**:
- A **Map** stores **key-value pairs**.
- **Keys are unique**, but **values can be duplicated**.
- **HashMap** is commonly used, but you can use **LinkedHashMap** if you need to maintain insertion order.
- You can easily create **immutable maps** with Java SE 9's factory methods.
- **Map.Entry**: This is like a **view** of the key-value pair. You can access the key with `getKey()` and the value with `getValue()`. You can even **update the value** using `setValue(value)`.

  
Maps are powerful tools for organizing and quickly accessing data by key, making them essential for many programming tasks.
