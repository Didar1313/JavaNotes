### Methods Added by SortedMap

**SortedMap** keeps the keys in a sorted order. You can get subsets or specific parts of the map using these methods:

- `firstKey()`: Get the smallest key.
- `lastKey()`: Get the largest key.
- `headMap(toKey)`: Get a view of keys less than `toKey`.
- `tailMap(fromKey)`: Get a view of keys greater than or equal to `fromKey`.

Example:
```java
SortedMap<Integer, String> headMap = map.headMap(3);  // keys < 3
```

### Methods Added by NavigableMap

**NavigableMap** extends **SortedMap** and adds more methods to work with specific keys and entries:

- `ceilingKey(key)`: Returns the smallest key greater than or equal to the given key.
- `higherKey(key)`: Returns the smallest key strictly greater than the given key.
- `floorKey(key)`: Returns the largest key less than or equal to the given key.
- `lowerKey(key)`: Returns the largest key strictly less than the given key.

For reverse order:
```java
NavigableSet<Integer> descendingKeys = map.descendingKeySet();
```

### Getting Submap Views

You can view parts of the map using `subMap`, `headMap`, and `tailMap`. These methods return views that can be modified, but you can't add keys outside the specified range.

Example:
```java
SortedMap<Integer, String> subMap = map.subMap(1, 3); // keys between 1 and 3
```
