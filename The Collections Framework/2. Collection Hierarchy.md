### ** Collection Interface Hierarchy**
The **Collections Framework** in Java has a structured hierarchy of interfaces and classes. At the top, we have the `Collection` interface, which is extended by `List`, `Set`, and others.

### **1. Avoiding Getting Lost in the Collection Hierarchy**

### **2. Iterable Interface**
- The `Iterable` interface is not part of the Collections Framework but is important because all collections implement it.
- It allows objects to be iterated using a `for-each` loop:
  ```java
  for (String element : collection) {
      // Do something with element
  }
  ```
- It requires implementing an `Iterator`.

---

### **3. Storing Elements in a Container with the Collection Interface)**
The `Collection` interface provides basic functionalities like:
- **Adding & Removing Elements**
- **Checking if an Element Exists**
- **Getting the Size of the Collection**
- **Subset checking** â†’ You can check if one set is completely inside another.  
- **Union** â†’ Combine two sets together.  
- **Intersection** â†’ Find common elements between two sets.  
- **Complement** â†’ Find elements that are in one set but not in another.
ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**  
  ```java
  Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
  Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(2, 3, 4));
  set1.addAll(set2);  // Union: {1, 2, 3, 4}
  set1.retainAll(set2);  // Intersection: {2, 3}
  set1.removeAll(set2);  // Complement: {1}
  ```
- **Iterating Over Elements**
- **Parallel Streaming**
- **Iterator** â†’ A way to loop through the collection manually.  
- **Stream** â†’ A modern way to process elements (even in parallel for performance).  

ðŸ‘‰ **Example:**  
```java
Iterator<String> iterator = collection.iterator();
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(iterator.next());
}

// Stream (modern way)
collection.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
```

### **4. Extending Collection with List**
- A `List` maintains the order of elements as they were added.
- **Indexes** are used to access elements.
- Key operations include:
  - Get an element by index
  - Insert, update, or delete elements at a specific position
  - Extract a sublist

---

### **5. Set Interface (Unique Elements)**
- A `Set` does **not allow duplicate elements**.
- Adding an element may fail if it already exists.
- Unlike `List`, elements in a `Set` do not have an index.

---

### **6. Sorting the element of a Set with SortedSet and NavigableSet**
Both extend **Set**, adding more functionalities.

#### **SortedSet**
- **Keeps elements sorted in ascending order**.
- To decide the order, it uses:  
  âœ… The **Comparable** interface (if elements implement it).  
  âœ… A **Comparator** (which you provide).  

#### **NavigableSet**
- Extends `SortedSet`, **adding more ways to navigate** through the elements.
- Allows **iterating in descending order**.

---

### **Sorting vs Ordering**
- **Sorting** â†’ Arranges elements based on **their value** (e.g., numbers in ascending order).  
- **Ordering** â†’ Keeps elements in **the order they were added**.  

Example:
- `TreeSet` (SortedSet) **sorts elements**.
- `ArrayList` (List) **preserves insertion order**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- `Iterable` allows **looping over elements**.
- `Collection` provides **basic operations** for handling elements.
- `List` keeps elements **in order** and allows **duplicates**.
- `Set` prevents **duplicates**, but order is **not guaranteed**.
- `SortedSet` ensures **elements are always sorted**.
- `NavigableSet` adds **more ways to move through sorted elements**.
