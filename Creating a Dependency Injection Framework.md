## 1. ✅ What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

**Dependency Injection** is a way to **give an object the tools it needs** — without making it find or build those tools itself.

### 🔧 Analogy:

Think of a car. The engine is a dependency. Instead of the car building its own engine, someone installs it. That's **DI**.

---

### Example (Without DI):

```java
UserService service = new UserService(new UserRepository());
```

You're tightly coupling `UserService` with a specific `UserRepository`.

---

### Example (With DI):

```java
UserService service = beanFactory.getInstanceOf(UserService.class);
```

Now, `beanFactory` injects the right `UserRepository`. This makes your code **cleaner, more testable**, and **modular**.

---

## 2. 🛠️ Why Build a DI Framework?

Building it helps you learn:

✅ The **internal logic of Spring / Guice**
✅ How **loose coupling** makes your code easier to manage
✅ **Reflection** — a powerful Java feature
✅ How real frameworks manage object creation and wiring

---

## 3. 🔍 Understanding Reflection in Java

Reflection allows your program to:

* Look at its own structure (classes, methods, etc.)
* Create objects without knowing their exact type at compile time

---

### 🧪 Example:

```java
String s = "hello";
Class<?> clazz = s.getClass(); // → class java.lang.String
```

You can get class info and even **create** objects dynamically — which is perfect for DI.

---

## 4. 🧱 Introducing the `BeanFactory`

This class is the **heart of your DI system**.

It dynamically:

* Finds the constructor of a class
* Matches it with the given arguments
* Creates and returns the object

---

### 🔑 Code:

```java
public enum BeanFactory {
    INSTANCE;

    public <T> T getInstanceOf(Class<T> beanClass, Object... arguments) {
        try {
            Class<?>[] argumentsClasses = Arrays.stream(arguments)
                                                .map(Object::getClass)
                                                .toArray(Class<?>[]::new);
            Constructor<T> beanConstructor = beanClass.getConstructor(argumentsClasses);
            return beanConstructor.newInstance(arguments);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 5. 🔍 Step-by-Step Code Explanation

### ✅ Singleton Enum

```java
public enum BeanFactory {
    INSTANCE;
```

✅ Only one `BeanFactory` is ever created (like a manager you always call when you need a bean).

---

### ✅ Generic Method

```java
public <T> T getInstanceOf(Class<T> beanClass, Object... arguments)
```

This means the method can return **any class** type — flexibility!

---

### ✅ Get Argument Types

```java
Class<?>[] argumentsClasses = Arrays.stream(arguments)
                                    .map(Object::getClass)
                                    .toArray(Class<?>[]::new);
```

You get the **types of constructor parameters** (like `String`, `int`, `UserRepository`).

---

### ✅ Find Matching Constructor & Create Object

```java
Constructor<T> beanConstructor = beanClass.getConstructor(argumentsClasses);
return beanConstructor.newInstance(arguments);
```

Finds the exact constructor and builds the object for you — **automatically**.

---

## 6. 🧠 How This Relates to DI

This pattern removes **manual object creation**.

🔁 Instead of:

```java
OrderService orderService = new OrderService(new PaymentService());
```

You do:

```java
OrderService orderService = beanFactory.getInstanceOf(OrderService.class);
```

This separates **object creation** from **business logic**.

## 7. 📦 Real-Life Use Cases

| Use Case             | Why DI Helps                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Framework** | Creates and wires beans using annotations    |
| **Testing**          | Inject fake/mock classes for clean testing   |
| **Plugins**          | Dynamically load new features/modules        |
| **Big Projects**     | Helps manage complexity and class dependency |

---

## 8. ✅ Benefits and ❌ Drawbacks

| ✅ Benefits                   | ❌ Drawbacks                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Loosely coupled code         | Requires good understanding of Reflection      |
| Better testing & maintenance | Errors happen at runtime, not compile time     |
| Dynamic and flexible         | Slightly slower due to runtime object creation |
| Cleaner design               | More setup initially than using `new` directly |

---

## 9. 🎯 Conclusion

You’ve just built the **core concept of a DI framework**:

✅ Uses Reflection to find constructors
✅ Instantiates objects automatically
✅ Avoids tight coupling

This idea is **exactly** how **Spring** works at a basic level!

---

## 📚 Next Steps (To Build a Full DI Framework)

Here’s what you can do next:

1. **Singleton Support**
   Store already-created objects and reuse them.

2. **Auto Dependency Resolution**
   Don’t pass objects manually — let the framework resolve them recursively.

3. **Annotation Support**
   Use `@Inject`, `@Component`, or custom annotations to mark dependencies.

4. **Bean Registry**
   Register and retrieve objects by type or name.
