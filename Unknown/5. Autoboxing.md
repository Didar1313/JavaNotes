### ** Autoboxing in Java**
Autoboxing is the process of automatically converting a **primitive type** (e.g., `int`, `double`, `char`) into its corresponding **wrapper class** (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, `Character`). This feature was introduced in Java 5 to simplify working with generics and collections.

### **How It Works**
When you pass a primitive value to a method or a class that expects an object of its wrapper type, Java **automatically converts** the primitive into an instance of the wrapper class.

#### **Example of Autoboxing**
```java
Integer num = 10;  // Autoboxing: int 10 is converted to Integer.valueOf(10)
```
Here, `10` (a primitive `int`) is automatically converted to an `Integer` object.

#### **Example of Autoboxing in Generics**
In your case:
```java
Pair<String, Integer> p1 = new OrderedPair<>("Even", 8);
```
- `OrderedPair<String, Integer>` expects **String** and **Integer** as parameters.
- `8` is a **primitive int**.
- Due to **autoboxing**, Java automatically converts `8` into `Integer.valueOf(8)`, making it valid.

### **Unboxing (Reverse of Autoboxing)**
Java can also automatically convert wrapper objects **back** into primitives when needed.

#### **Example of Unboxing**
```java
Integer num = 10;   // Autoboxing
int value = num;    // Unboxing: Integer is converted to int automatically
```

### **Why Is Autoboxing Useful?**
1. **Simplifies code** â€“ You donâ€™t need to manually convert between primitive types and wrapper classes.
2. **Works with generics** â€“ Java's generics only support reference types (not primitives), so autoboxing allows you to use primitives seamlessly.
3. **Makes Collections easier to use** â€“ Collections like `ArrayList<Integer>` work without manually wrapping/unwrapping primitives.
