## ‚úÖ **Introducing the Stream API**

The **Stream API** was introduced in Java 8 and is one of its most powerful features‚Äîsecond only to lambda expressions.

Think of it like this:

* Java Collections (like `List`, `Set`) store and organize your data in memory.
* The Stream API **processes** that data efficiently using methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

You can open a **stream** on a collection to process its data. But streams aren't limited to collections ‚Äî you can also use them with:

* File and I/O sources
* Custom data sources you build yourself

When you understand streams well, you can write very **clear and powerful** code. Here‚Äôs an example:

```java
List<String> strings = List.of("one", "two", "three", "four");

var map = strings.stream()
                 .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length, Collectors.counting()));

map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + " :: " + value));
```

**Output:**

```
3 :: 2
4 :: 1
5 :: 1
```

This:

* Groups strings by their length
* Counts how many strings fall into each group
* Stores it in a `Map<Integer, Long>`

Even if you're new to streams, the code **explains itself**.

## üßÆ **Introducing the Map-Filter-Reduce Algorithm**

Before we dive deeper, let‚Äôs explore the idea of **Map-Filter-Reduce**, the core logic behind streams.

Imagine you have a `Sale` object with:

* a product name
* a date
* an amount (as an `int`)

Here‚Äôs the record:

```java
public record Sale(String product, LocalDate date, int amount) {}
```

Suppose you want to compute the **total sales in October**. Here‚Äôs a basic way to do it:

```java
List<Sale> sales = List.of(
    new Sale("Orange", LocalDate.of(2022, Month.JANUARY, 2), 4),
    new Sale("Pumpkin", LocalDate.of(2022, Month.OCTOBER, 18), 12),
    new Sale("Butternut", LocalDate.of(2022, Month.OCTOBER, 3), 6),
    new Sale("Apple", LocalDate.of(2022, Month.AUGUST, 28), 3)
);

int amountSoldInOctober = 0;

for (Sale sale : sales) {
    if (sale.date().getMonth() == Month.OCTOBER) {
        amountSoldInOctober += sale.amount();
    }
}

System.out.println("Amount sold in October: " + amountSoldInOctober);
```

### üîç This does three things:

1. **Filter**: Keep only sales in October.
2. **Map**: Extract the amount from each `Sale`.
3. **Reduce**: Add up all the amounts.

In SQL, the same logic is written like this:

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM Sales
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 10;
```

This is a **declarative approach**‚Äîyou describe the result, and the database engine figures out how to get it.

---

## üßæ **Specifying a Result Instead of Programming an Algorithm**

In SQL, you describe *what* you want. In Java loops, you describe *how* to get it.

Streams help you write Java code that's **closer to SQL**‚Äîyou specify the goal, not every step.

This makes your code:

* Easier to read
* Easier to optimize

---

## üîÑ **Mapping Objects to Other Objects or Values**

**Mapping** is about transforming objects‚Äîlike turning a `Sale` into an `int` (its amount), or a `Person` into their name.

* It‚Äôs a one-to-one transformation
* Order is preserved
* Object types change, **not the number of objects**

In streams, this is done using the `map()` method, which uses the `Function<T, R>` interface.

---

## üîç **Filtering Out Objects**

**Filtering** removes some items based on a condition.

* Types stay the same
* The number of objects may shrink

This uses the `filter()` method, with a `Predicate<T>` functional interface that returns `true` or `false`.

---

## ‚ûï **Reducing Objects to Produce a Result**

**Reduction** means combining everything into one final value.

Common reductions:

* `count()`
* `sum()`
* `min()` / `max()`
* `average()`

You‚Äôll often use `.collect()` with a **Collector**, like:

```java
Collectors.groupingBy()
Collectors.toList()
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimizing the Map-Filter-Reduce Algorithm**

Let‚Äôs say you have a list of cities and want the **total population** of those with more than 100,000 people.

Without streams:

```java
record City(int population) {}

List<City> cities = List.of(
    new City(100_000),
    new City(200_000),
    new City(500_000)
);

int sum = 0;
for (City city : cities) {
    if (city.population() > 100_000) {
        sum += city.population();
    }
}
System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
```

With streams:

```java
int sum = cities.stream()
    .mapToInt(City::population)
    .filter(p -> p > 100_000)
    .sum();
```

This is:

* Shorter
* Clearer
* More efficient

## üö´ Why Not Add `map()` and `filter()` to List?

Imagine this:

```java
Collection<Integer> mapped = cities.map(City::population);
```

Looks nice, right? But‚Ä¶

üß® Problem: Each step would create a new collection in memory.
üí£ Bigger problem: For huge data, this would be slow and waste memory.

---

## üö∞ **The Stream Interface and Lazy Processing**

```java
Stream<City> streamOfCities = cities.stream();
Stream<Integer> populations = streamOfCities.map(City::population);
Stream<Integer> filtered = populations.filter(p -> p > 100_000);
int sum = filtered.sum(); // ‚ö†Ô∏è This won‚Äôt compile yet ‚Äì sum() only exists on IntStream
```

Key point:

> A **stream does not store data**.

Processing only happens when a **terminal operation** (like `sum()` or `collect()`) is called.

---

## üîÑ **Creating a Pipeline with Intermediate Operations**

* Operations like `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()` are called **intermediate operations**
* They return a **new stream**
* No data is processed until the **terminal operation**

---

## üîö **Computing a Result with a Terminal Operation**

* Terminal operations are things like `collect()`, `sum()`, `forEach()`
* Once a terminal operation runs, the stream is **used up**
* Using it again causes an `IllegalStateException`

Example:

```java
var stream = Stream.of(1, 2, 3);

// First use: OK
var result = stream.map(i -> i + 1);

// Second use: ‚ùå Error
var list = stream.toList();
```

---

## üî¢ **Avoiding Boxing with Specialized Streams of Numbers**

Java provides three special streams to work with **primitive numbers**:

* `IntStream`
* `LongStream`
* `DoubleStream`

They avoid boxing (e.g., converting `int` to `Integer`) and are more efficient.

They support:

* `.sum()`
* `.min()`, `.max()`
* `.average()`
* `.summaryStatistics()`

---

## ‚úÖ **Following Good Practices**

* **Don't reuse** a stream after it‚Äôs been used once
* **Don‚Äôt store** streams in variables unnecessarily
* **Create and use** streams in one go
* **Avoid side effects** (don‚Äôt change outside variables from inside a stream)
* **Don‚Äôt modify the source** collection during stream processing

---

## üéØ Final Thoughts

The Stream API brings the **power of functional programming** to Java in a simple and elegant way.

By learning how to use:

* `map()`
* `filter()`
* `reduce()`
  ‚Ä¶and other stream methods, you can write **cleaner, faster, and more maintainable** Java code.

Stick to the core ideas, follow best practices, and streams will become one of your favorite tools in Java.
